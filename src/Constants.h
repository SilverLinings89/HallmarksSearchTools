const string hallmark1_name = "Sustaining Proliferative Signaling";
const string hallmark1_description = "Arguably the most fundamental trait of cancer cells involves their ability to sustain chronic proliferation. Normal tissues carefully control the production and release of growth-promoting signals that instruct entry into and progression through the cell growth-and-division cycle, thereby ensuring a homeostasis of cell number and thus maintenance of normal tissue architecture and function. Cancer cells, by deregulating these signals, become masters of their own destinies. The enabling signals are conveyed in large part by growth factors that bind cell-surface receptors, typically containing intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. The latter proceed to emit signals via branched intracellular signaling pathways that regulate progression through the cell cycle as well as cell growth (that is, increases in cell size); often these signals influence yet other cell-biological properties, such as cell survival and energy metabolism. Remarkably, the precise identities and sources of the proliferative signals operating within normal tissues were poorly understood a decade ago and in general remain so. Moreover, we still know relatively little about the mechanisms controlling the release of these mitogenic signals. In part, the understanding of these mechanisms is complicated by the fact that the growth factor signals controlling cell number and position within tissues are thought to be transmitted in a temporally and spatially regulated fashion from one cell to its neighbors; such paracrine signaling is difficult to access experimentally. In addition, the bioavailability of growth factors is regulated by sequestration in the pericellular space and extracellular matrix, and by the actions of a complex network of proteases, sulfatases, and possibly other enzymes that liberate and activate them, apparently in a highly specific and localized fashion. The mitogenic signaling in cancer cells is, in contrast, better understood. Cancer cells can acquire the capability to sustain proliferative signaling in a number of alternative ways: They may produce growth factor ligands themselves, to which they can respond via the expression of cognate receptors, resulting in autocrine proliferative stimulation. Alternatively, cancer cells may send signals to stimulate normal cells within the supporting tumor-associated stroma, which reciprocate by supplying the cancer cells with various growth factors. Receptor signaling can also be deregulated by elevating the levels of receptor proteins displayed at the cancer cell surface, rendering such cells hyperresponsive to otherwise-limiting amounts of growth factor ligand; the same outcome can result from structural alterations in the receptor molecules that facilitate ligand-independent firing. Growth factor independence may also derive from the constitutive activation of components of signaling pathways operating downstream of these receptors, obviating the need to stimulate these pathways by ligand-mediated receptor activation. Given that a number of distinct downstream signaling pathways radiate from a ligand-stimulated receptor, the activation of one or another of these downstream pathways, for example, the one responding to the Ras signal transducer, may only recapitulate a subset of the regulatory instructions transmitted by an activated receptor. Somatic Mutations Activate Additional Downstream Pathways. High-throughput DNA sequencing analyses of cancer cell genomes have revealed somatic mutations in certain human tumors that predict constitutive activation of signaling circuits usually triggered by activated growth factor receptors. Thus, we now know that ∼40% of human melanomas contain activating mutations affecting the structure of the B-Raf protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-kinase pathway. Similarly, mutations in the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) isoforms are being detected in an array of tumor types, which serve to hyperactivate the PI3-kinase signaling circuitry, including its key Akt/PKB signal transducer. The advantages to tumor cells of activating upstream (receptor) versus downstream (transducer) signaling remain obscure, as does the functional impact of crosstalk between the multiple pathways radiating from growth factor receptors. Disruptions of Negative-Feedback Mechanisms that Attenuate Proliferative Signaling. Recent results have highlighted the importance of negative-feedback loops that normally operate to dampen various types of signaling and thereby ensure homeostatic regulation of the flux of signals coursing through the intracellular circuitry. Defects in these feedback mechanisms are capable of enhancing proliferative signaling. The prototype of this type of regulation involves the Ras oncoprotein: the oncogenic effects of Ras do not result from a hyperactivation of its signaling powers; instead, the oncogenic mutations affecting ras genes compromise Ras GTPase activity, which operates as an intrinsic negative-feedback mechanism that normally ensures that active signal transmission is transitory. Analogous negative-feedback mechanisms operate at multiple nodes within the proliferative signaling circuitry. A prominent example involves the PTEN phosphatase, which counteracts PI3-kinase by degrading its product, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate (PIP3). Loss-of-function mutations in PTEN amplify PI3K signaling and promote tumorigenesis in a variety of experimental models of cancer; in human tumors, PTEN expression is often lost by promoter methylation. Yet another example involves the mTOR kinase, a coordinator of cell growth and metabolism that lies both upstream and downstream of the PI3K pathway. In the circuitry of some cancer cells, mTOR activation results, via negative feedback, in the inhibition of PI3K signaling. Thus, when mTOR is pharmacologically inhibited in such cancer cells (such as by the drug rapamycin), the associated loss of negative feedback results in increased activity of PI3K and its effector Akt/PKB, thereby blunting the antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibition. It is likely that compromised negative-feedback loops in this and other signaling pathways will prove to be widespread among human cancer cells and serve as an important means by which these cells can achieve proliferative independence. Moreover, disruption of such self-attenuating signaling may contribute to the development of adaptive resistance toward drugs targeting mitogenic signaling. Early studies of oncogene action encouraged the notion that ever-increasing expression of such genes and the signals manifested in their protein products would result in correspondingly increased cancer cell proliferation and thus tumor growth. More recent research has undermined this notion, in that excessively elevated signaling by oncoproteins such as RAS, MYC, and RAF can provoke counteracting responses from cells, specifically induction of cell senescence and/or apoptosis. For example, cultured cells expressing high levels of the Ras oncoprotein may enter into the nonproliferative but viable state called senescence; in contrast, cells expressing lower levels of this protein may avoid senescence and proliferate. Cells with morphological features of senescence, including enlarged cytoplasm, the absence of proliferation markers, and expression of the senescence-induced β-galactosidase enzyme, are abundant in the tissues of mice engineered to overexpress certain oncogenes and are prevalent in some cases of human melanoma. These ostensibly paradoxical responses seem to reflect intrinsic cellular defense mechanisms designed to eliminate cells experiencing excessive levels of certain types of signaling. Accordingly, the relative intensity of oncogenic signaling in cancer cells may represent compromises between maximal mitogenic stimulation and avoidance of these antiproliferative defenses. Alternatively, some cancer cells may adapt to high levels of oncogenic signaling by disabling their senescence- or apoptosis-inducing circuitry.";

const string hallmark2_name = "Evading Growth Suppressors";
const string hallmark2_description = "In addition to the hallmark capability of inducing and sustaining positively acting growth-stimulatory signals, cancer cells must also circumvent powerful programs that negatively regulate cell proliferation; many of these programs depend on the actions of tumor suppressor genes. Dozens of tumor suppressors that operate in various ways to limit cell growth and proliferation have been discovered through their characteristic inactivation in one or another form of animal or human cancer; many of these genes have been validated as bona fide tumor suppressors through gain- or loss-of-function experiments in mice. The two prototypical tumor suppressors encode the RB (retinoblastoma-associated) and TP53 proteins; they operate as central control nodes within two key complementary cellular regulatory circuits that govern the decisions of cells to proliferate or, alternatively, activate senescence and apoptotic programs. The RB protein integrates signals from diverse extracellular and intracellular sources and, in response, decides whether or not a cell should proceed through its growth-and-division cycle. Cancer cells with defects in RB pathway function are thus missing the services of a critical gatekeeper of cell-cycle progression whose absence permits persistent cell proliferation. Whereas RB transduces growth-inhibitory signals that originate largely outside of the cell, TP53 receives inputs from stress and abnormality sensors that function within the cell's intracellular operating systems: if the degree of damage to the genome is excessive, or if the levels of nucleotide pools, growth-promoting signals, glucose, or oxygenation are suboptimal, TP53 can call a halt to further cell-cycle progression until these conditions have been normalized. Alternatively, in the face of alarm signals indicating overwhelming or irreparable damage to such cellular subsystems, TP53 can trigger apoptosis. Notably, the various effects of activated TP53 are complex and highly context dependent, varying by cell type as well as by the severity and persistence of conditions of cell stress and genomic damage. Although the two canonical suppressors of proliferation—TP53 and RB—have preeminent importance in regulating cell proliferation, various lines of evidence indicate that each operates as part of a larger network that is wired for functional redundancy. For example, chimeric mice populated throughout their bodies with individual cells lacking a functional Rb gene are surprisingly free of proliferative abnormalities, despite the expectation that loss of RB function would allow continuous firing of the cell division cycle in these cells and their lineal descendants; some of the resulting clusters of Rb null cells should, by all rights, progress to neoplasia. Instead, the Rb null cells in such chimeric mice have been found to participate in relatively normal tissue morphogenesis throughout the body; the only neoplasia observed was in the development of pituitary tumors late in life. Similarly, TP53 null mice develop normally, show largely proper cell and tissue homeostasis, and again develop abnormalities later in life, in the form of leukemias and sarcomas. Both examples must reflect the operations of redundantly acting mechanisms that serve to constrain inappropriate replication of cells lacking these key proliferation suppressors. Mechanisms of Contact Inhibition and Its Evasion. Four decades of research have demonstrated that the cell-to-cell contacts formed by dense populations of normal cells propagated in two-dimensional culture operate to suppress further cell proliferation, yielding confluent cell monolayers. Importantly, such “contact inhibition” is abolished in various types of cancer cells in culture, suggesting that contact inhibition is an in vitro surrogate of a mechanism that operates in vivo to ensure normal tissue homeostasis, one that is abrogated during the course of tumorigenesis. Until recently, the mechanistic basis for this mode of growth control remained obscure. Now, however, mechanisms of contact inhibition are beginning to emerge. One mechanism involves the product of the NF2 gene, long implicated as a tumor suppressor because its loss triggers a form of human neurofibromatosis. Merlin, the cytoplasmic NF2 gene product, orchestrates contact inhibition via coupling cell-surface adhesion molecules (e.g., E-cadherin) to transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., the EGF receptor). In so doing, Merlin strengthens the adhesivity of cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell attachments. Additionally, by sequestering growth factor receptors, Merlin limits their ability to efficiently emit mitogenic signals. A second mechanism of contact inhibition involves the LKB1 epithelial polarity protein, which organizes epithelial structure and helps maintain tissue integrity. LKB1 can, for example, overrule the mitogenic effects of the powerful Myc oncogene when the latter is upregulated in organized, quiescent epithelial structures; in contrast, when LKB1 expression is suppressed, epithelial integrity is destabilized, and epithelial cells become susceptible to Myc-induced transformation. LKB1 has also been identified as a tumor suppressor gene that is lost in certain human malignancies, possibly reflecting its normal function as a suppressor of inappropriate proliferation. It remains to be seen how frequently these two mechanisms of contact-mediated growth suppression are compromised in human cancers; no doubt yet other contact-induced proliferative barriers are yet to be discovered. Clearly mechanisms like these that enable cells to construct and maintain architecturally complex tissues represent important means of suppressing and counterbalancing inappropriate proliferative signals. Corruption of the TGF-β Pathway Promotes Malignancy. TGF-β is best known for its antiproliferative effects, and evasion by cancer cells of these effects is now appreciated to be far more elaborate than simple shutdown of its signaling circuitry. In many late-stage tumors, TGF-β signaling is redirected away from suppressing cell proliferation and is found instead to activate a cellular program, termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), that confers on cancer cells traits associated with high-grade malignancy, as discussed in further detail below.";

const string hallmark3_name = "Resisting Cell Death";
const string hallmark3_description = "The concept that programmed cell death by apoptosis serves as a natural barrier to cancer development has been established by compelling functional studies conducted over the last two decades. Elucidation of the signaling circuitry governing the apoptotic program has revealed how apoptosis is triggered in response to various physiologic stresses that cancer cells experience during the course of tumorigenesis or as a result of anticancer therapy. Notable among the apoptosis-inducing stresses are signaling imbalances resulting from elevated levels of oncogene signaling, as mentioned earlier, and DNA damage associated with hyperproliferation. Yet other research has revealed how apoptosis is attenuated in those tumors that succeed in progressing to states of high-grade malignancy and resistance to therapy. The apoptotic machinery is composed of both upstream regulators and downstream effector components. The regulators, in turn, are divided into two major circuits, one receiving and processing extracellular death-inducing signals (the extrinsic apoptotic program, involving for example the Fas ligand/Fas receptor), and the other sensing and integrating a variety of signals of intracellular origin (the intrinsic program). Each culminates in activation of a normally latent protease (caspases 8 and 9, respectively), which proceeds to initiate a cascade of proteolysis involving effector caspases responsible for the execution phase of apoptosis, in which the cell is progressively disassembled and then consumed, both by its neighbors and by professional phagocytic cells. Currently, the intrinsic apoptotic program is more widely implicated as a barrier to cancer pathogenesis. The “apoptotic trigger” that conveys signals between the regulators and effectors is controlled by counterbalancing pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of regulatory proteins. The archetype, Bcl-2, along with its closest relatives (Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, A1) are inhibitors of apoptosis, acting in large part by binding to and thereby suppressing two proapoptotic triggering proteins (Bax and Bak); the latter are embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane. When relieved of inhibition by their antiapoptotic relatives, Bax and Bak disrupt the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane, causing the release of proapoptotic signaling proteins, the most important of which is cytochrome c. The released cytochrome c activates, in turn, a cascade of caspases that act via their proteolytic activities to induce the multiple cellular changes associated with the apoptotic program. Bax and Bak share protein-protein interaction domains, termed BH3 motifs, with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins that mediate their various physical interactions. The activities of a subfamily of related proteins, each of which contains a single such BH3 motif, are coupled to a variety of sensors of cellular abnormality; these “BH3-only” proteins act either by interfering with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or by directly stimulating the proapoptotic members of this family. Although the cellular conditions that trigger apoptosis remain to be fully enumerated, several abnormality sensors that play key roles in tumor development have been identified. Most notable is a DNA-damage sensor that functions via the TP53 tumor suppressor; TP53 induces apoptosis by upregulating expression of the Noxa and Puma BH3-only proteins, doing so in response to substantial levels of DNA breaks and other chromosomal abnormalities. Alternatively, insufficient survival factor signaling (for instance inadequate levels of interleukin-3 in lymphocytes or of insulin-like growth factor 1/2 [Igf1/2] in epithelial cells) can elicit apoptosis through a BH3-only protein called Bim. Yet another condition leading to cell death involves hyperactive signaling by certain oncoproteins, such as Myc, which triggers apoptosis (in part via Bim and other BH3-only proteins) unless counterbalanced by antiapoptotic factors. Tumor cells evolve a variety of strategies to limit or circumvent apoptosis. Most common is the loss of TP53 tumor suppressor function, which eliminates this critical damage sensor from the apoptosis-inducing circuitry. Alternatively, tumors may achieve similar ends by increasing expression of antiapoptotic regulators (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) or of survival signals (Igf1/2), by downregulating proapoptotic factors (Bax, Bim, Puma), or by short-circuiting the extrinsic ligand-induced death pathway. The multiplicity of apoptosis-avoiding mechanisms presumably reflects the diversity of apoptosis-inducing signals that cancer cell populations encounter during their evolution to the malignant state. The structure of the apoptotic machinery and program, and the strategies used by cancer cells to evade its actions, were widely appreciated by the beginning of the last decade. The most notable conceptual advances since then have involved other forms of cell death that broaden the scope of “programmed cell death” as a barrier to cancer. Autophagy Mediates Both Tumor Cell Survival and Death. Autophagy represents an important cell-physiologic response that, like apoptosis, normally operates at low, basal levels in cells but can be strongly induced in certain states of cellular stress, the most obvious of which is nutrient deficiency. The autophagic program enables cells to break down cellular organelles, such as ribosomes and mitochondria, allowing the resulting catabolites to be recycled and thus used for biosynthesis and energy metabolism. As part of this program, intracellular vesicles termed autophagosomes envelope intracellular organelles and then fuse with lysosomes wherein degradation occurs. In this fashion, low-molecular-weight metabolites are generated that support survival in the stressed, nutrient-limited environments experienced by many cancer cells. Like apoptosis, the autophagy machinery has both regulatory and effector components. Among the latter are proteins that mediate autophagosome formation and delivery to lysosomes. Of note, recent research has revealed intersections between the regulatory circuits governing autophagy, apoptosis, and cellular homeostasis. For example, the signaling pathway involving the PI3-kinase, AKT, and mTOR kinases, which is stimulated by survival signals to block apoptosis, similarly inhibits autophagy; when survival signals are insufficient, the PI3K signaling pathway is downregulated, with the result that autophagy and/or apoptosis may be induced. Another interconnection between these two programs resides in the Beclin-1 protein, which has been shown by genetic studies to be necessary for induction of autophagy. Beclin-1 is a member of the BH3-only subfamily of apoptotic regulatory proteins, and its BH3 domain allows it to bind the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL proteins. Stress-sensor-coupled BH3 proteins can displace Beclin-1 from its association with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, enabling the liberated Beclin-1 to trigger autophagy, much as they can release proapoptotic Bax and Bak to trigger apoptosis. Hence, stress-transducing BH3 proteins (e.g., Bid, Bad, Puma, et al.) can induce apoptosis and/or autophagy depending on the physiologic state of the cell. Mice bearing inactivated alleles of the Beclin-1 gene or of certain other components of the autophagy machinery exhibit increased susceptibility to cancer. These results suggest that induction of autophagy can serve as a barrier to tumorigenesis that may operate independently of or in concert with apoptosis. Accordingly, autophagy appears to represent yet another barrier that needs to be circumvented during tumor development. Perhaps paradoxically, nutrient starvation, radiotherapy, and certain cytotoxic drugs can induce elevated levels of autophagy that are apparently cytoprotective for cancer cells, impairing rather than accentuating the killing actions of these stress-inducing situations. Moreover, severely stressed cancer cells have been shown to shrink via autophagy to a state of reversible dormancy. This survival response may enable the persistence and eventual regrowth of some late-stage tumors following treatment with potent anticancer agents. Thus, in analogy to TGF-β signaling, which can be tumor suppressing at early stages of tumorigenesis and tumor promoting later on, autophagy seems to have conflicting effects on tumor cells and thus tumor progression. An important agenda for future research will involve clarifying the genetic and cell-physiologic conditions that dictate when and how autophagy enables cancer cells to survive or causes them to die. Necrosis Has Proinflammatory and Tumor-Promoting Potential. In contrast to apoptosis, in which a dying cell contracts into an almost-invisible corpse that is soon consumed by neighbors, necrotic cells become bloated and explode, releasing their contents into the local tissue microenvironment. Although necrosis has historically been viewed much like organismic death, as a form of system-wide exhaustion and breakdown, the conceptual landscape is changing: cell death by necrosis is clearly under genetic control in some circumstances, rather than being a random and undirected process. Perhaps more important, necrotic cell death releases proinflammatory signals into the surrounding tissue microenvironment, in contrast to apoptosis and autophagy, which do not. As a consequence, necrotic cells can recruit inflammatory cells of the immune system, whose dedicated function is to survey the extent of tissue damage and remove associated necrotic debris. In the context of neoplasia, however, multiple lines of evidence indicate that immune inflammatory cells can be actively tumor promoting, given that such cells are capable of fostering angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, and invasiveness (see below). Additionally, necrotic cells can release bioactive regulatory factors, such as IL-1α, which can directly stimulate neighboring viable cells to proliferate, with the potential, once again, to facilitate neoplastic progression. Consequently, necrotic cell death, while seemingly beneficial in counterbalancing cancer-associated hyperproliferation, may ultimately do more damage than good. Accordingly, incipient neoplasias and potentially invasive and metastatic tumors may gain an advantage by tolerating some degree of necrotic cell death, doing so in order to recruit tumor-promoting inflammatory cells that bring growth-stimulating factors to the surviving cells within these growths.";

const string hallmark4_name = "Enabling Replicative Immortality";
const string hallmark4_description = "By 2000, it was widely accepted that cancer cells require unlimited replicative potential in order to generate macroscopic tumors. This capability stands in marked contrast to the behavior of the cells in most normal cell lineages in the body, which are able to pass through only a limited number of successive cell growth-and-division cycles. This limitation has been associated with two distinct barriers to proliferation: senescence, a typically irreversible entrance into a nonproliferative but viable state, and crisis, which involves cell death. Accordingly, when cells are propagated in culture, repeated cycles of cell division lead first to induction of senescence and then, for those cells that succeed in circumventing this barrier, to a crisis phase, in which the great majority of cells in the population die. On rare occasion, cells emerge from a population in crisis and exhibit unlimited replicative potential. This transition has been termed immortalization, a trait that most established cell lines possess by virtue of their ability to proliferate in culture without evidence of either senescence or crisis. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that telomeres protecting the ends of chromosomes are centrally involved in the capability for unlimited proliferation. The telomeres, composed of multiple tandem hexanucleotide repeats, shorten progressively in nonimmortalized cells propagated in culture, eventually losing the ability to protect the ends of chromosomal DNAs from end-to-end fusions; such fusions generate unstable dicentric chromosomes whose resolution results in a scrambling of karyotype that threatens cell viability. Accordingly, the length of telomeric DNA in a cell dictates how many successive cell generations its progeny can pass through before telomeres are largely eroded and have consequently lost their protective functions, triggering entrance into crisis. Telomerase, the specialized DNA polymerase that adds telomere repeat segments to the ends of telomeric DNA, is almost absent in nonimmortalized cells but expressed at functionally significant levels in the vast majority (∼90%) of spontaneously immortalized cells, including human cancer cells. By extending telomeric DNA, telomerase is able to counter the progressive telomere erosion that would otherwise occur in its absence. The presence of telomerase activity, either in spontaneously immortalized cells or in the context of cells engineered to express the enzyme, is correlated with a resistance to induction of both senescence and crisis/apoptosis; conversely, suppression of telomerase activity leads to telomere shortening and to activation of one or the other of these proliferative barriers. The two barriers to proliferation—senescence and crisis/apoptosis—have been rationalized as crucial anticancer defenses that are hard-wired into our cells, being deployed to impede the outgrowth of clones of preneoplastic and frankly neoplastic cells. According to this thinking, most incipient neoplasias exhaust their endowment of replicative doublings and are stopped in their tracks by one or the other of these barriers. The eventual immortalization of rare variant cells that proceed to form tumors has been attributed to their ability to maintain telomeric DNA at lengths sufficient to avoid triggering senescence or apoptosis, achieved most commonly by upregulating expression of telomerase or, less frequently, via an alternative recombination-based telomere maintenance mechanism. Hence, telomere shortening has come to be viewed as a clocking device that determines the limited replicative potential of normal cells and thus one that must be overcome by cancer cells. Reassessing Replicative Senescence. Whereas telomere maintenance has been increasingly substantiated as a condition critical to the neoplastic state, the concept of replication-induced senescence as a general barrier requires refinement and reformulation. (Differences in telomere structure and function in mouse versus human cells have also complicated investigation of the roles of telomeres and telomerase in replicative senescence.) Recent experiments have revealed that the induction of senescence in certain cultured cells can be delayed and possibly eliminated by the use of improved cell culture conditions, suggesting that recently explanted primary cells may be able to proliferate unimpeded in culture up the point of crisis and the associated induction of apoptosis triggered by critically shortened telomeres. In contrast, experiments in mice engineered to lack telomerase indicate that the consequently shortened telomeres can shunt premalignant cells into a senescent state that contributes (along with apoptosis) to attenuated tumorigenesis in mice genetically destined to develop particular forms of cancer. Such telomerase null mice with highly eroded telomeres exhibit multiorgan dysfunction and abnormalities that include evidence for both senescence and apoptosis, perhaps analogous to the senescence and apoptosis observed in cell culture. Of note, and as discussed earlier, a morphologically similar form of cell senescence induced by excessive or unbalanced oncogene signaling is now well documented as a protective mechanism against neoplasia; the possible interconnections of this form of senescence with telomerase and telomeres remain to be ascertained. Thus, cell senescence is emerging conceptually as a protective barrier to neoplastic expansion that can be triggered by various proliferation-associated abnormalities, including high levels of oncogenic signaling and, apparently, subcritical shortening of telomeres. Delayed Activation of Telomerase May Both Limit and Foster Neoplastic Progression. There is now evidence that clones of incipient cancer cells often experience telomere loss-induced crisis relatively early during the course of multistep tumor progression due to their inability to express significant levels of telomerase. Thus, extensively eroded telomeres have been documented in premalignant growths through the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which has also revealed the end-to-end chromosomal fusions that signal telomere failure and crisis. These results also suggest that such cells have passed through a substantial number of successive telomere-shortening cell divisions during their evolution from fully normal cells-of-origin. Accordingly, the development of some human neoplasias may be aborted by telomere-induced crisis long before they succeed in becoming macroscopic, frankly neoplastic growths. In contrast, the absence of TP53-mediated surveillance of genomic integrity may permit other incipient neoplasias to survive initial telomere erosion and attendant chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. The genomic alterations resulting from these BFB cycles, including deletions and amplifications of chromosomal segments, evidently serve to increase the mutability of the genome, thereby accelerating the acquisition of mutant oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The realization that impaired telomere function can actually foster tumor progression has come from the study of mutant mice that lack both p53 and telomerase function. The proposition that these two defects can cooperatively enhance human tumorigenesis has not yet been directly documented. Circumstantial support for the importance of transient telomere deficiency in facilitating malignant progression has come, in addition, from comparative analyses of premalignant and malignant lesions in the human breast. The premalignant lesions did not express significant levels of telomerase and were marked by telomere shortening and nonclonal chromosomal aberrations. In contrast, overt carcinomas exhibited telomerase expression concordantly with the reconstruction of longer telomeres and the fixation (via clonal outgrowth) of the aberrant karyotypes that would seem to have been acquired after telomere failure but before the acquisition of telomerase activity. When portrayed in this way, the delayed acquisition of telomerase function serves to generate tumor-promoting mutations, whereas its subsequent activation stabilizes the mutant genome and confers the unlimited replicative capacity that cancer cells require in order to generate clinically apparent tumors. New Functions of Telomerase. Telomerase was discovered because of its ability to elongate and maintain telomeric DNA, and almost all telomerase research has been posited on the notion that its functions are confined to this crucial function. However, in recent years it has become apparent that telomerase exerts functions that are relevant to cell proliferation but unrelated to telomere maintenance. The noncanonical roles of telomerase, and in particular its protein subunit TERT, have been revealed by functional studies in mice and cultured cells; in some cases novel functions have been demonstrated in conditions where the telomerase enzymatic activity has been eliminated. Among the growing list of telomere-independent functions of TERT/telomerase is the ability of TERT to amplify signaling by the Wnt pathway, by serving as a cofactor of the β-catenin/LEF transcription factor complex. Other ascribed telomere-independent effects include demonstrable enhancement of cell proliferation and/or resistance to apoptosis, involvement in DNA-damage repair, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function. Consistent with these broader roles, TERT can be found associated with chromatin at multiple sites along the chromosomes, not just at the telomeres. Hence, telomere maintenance is proving to be the most prominent of a diverse series of functions to which TERT contributes. The contributions of these additional functions of telomerase to tumorigenesis remain to be fully elucidated.";

const string hallmark5_name = "Inducing Angiogenesis";
const string hallmark5_description = "Like normal tissues, tumors require sustenance in the form of nutrients and oxygen as well as an ability to evacuate metabolic wastes and carbon dioxide. The tumor-associated neovasculature, generated by the process of angiogenesis, addresses these needs. During embryogenesis, the development of the vasculature involves the birth of new endothelial cells and their assembly into tubes (vasculogenesis) in addition to the sprouting (angiogenesis) of new vessels from existing ones. Following this morphogenesis, the normal vasculature becomes largely quiescent. In the adult, as part of physiologic processes such as wound healing and female reproductive cycling, angiogenesis is turned on, but only transiently. In contrast, during tumor progression, an “angiogenic switch” is almost always activated and remains on, causing normally quiescent vasculature to continually sprout new vessels that help sustain expanding neoplastic growths. A compelling body of evidence indicates that the angiogenic switch is governed by countervailing factors that either induce or oppose angiogenesis. Some of these angiogenic regulators are signaling proteins that bind to stimulatory or inhibitory cell-surface receptors displayed by vascular endothelial cells. The well-known prototypes of angiogenesis inducers and inhibitors are vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), respectively. The VEGF-A gene encodes ligands that are involved in orchestrating new blood vessel growth during embryonic and postnatal development, and then in homeostatic survival of endothelial cells, as well as in physiological and pathological situations in the adult. VEGF signaling via three receptor tyrosine kinases (VEGFR-1–3) is regulated at multiple levels, reflecting this complexity of purpose. Thus, VEGF gene expression can by upregulated both by hypoxia and by oncogene signaling. Additionally, VEGF ligands can be sequestered in the extracellular matrix in latent forms that are subject to release and activation by extracellular matrix-degrading proteases. In addition, other proangiogenic signals, such as members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, have been implicated in sustaining tumor angiogenesis when their expression is chronically upregulated. TSP-1, a key counterbalance in the angiogenic switch, also binds transmembrane receptors displayed by endothelial cells and thereby evokes suppressive signals that can counteract proangiogenic stimuli. The blood vessels produced within tumors by chronically activated angiogenesis and an unbalanced mix of proangiogenic signals are typically aberrant: tumor neovasculature is marked by precocious capillary sprouting, convoluted and excessive vessel branching, distorted and enlarged vessels, erratic blood flow, microhemorrhaging, leakiness, and abnormal levels of endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Angiogenesis is induced surprisingly early during the multistage development of invasive cancers both in animal models and in humans. Histological analyses of premalignant, noninvasive lesions, including dysplasias and in situ carcinomas arising in a variety of organs, have revealed the early tripping of the angiogenic switch. Historically, angiogenesis was envisioned to be important only when rapidly growing macroscopic tumors had formed, but more recent data indicate that angiogenesis also contributes to the microscopic premalignant phase of neoplastic progression, further cementing its status as an integral hallmark of cancer. The past decade has witnessed an astonishing outpouring of research on angiogenesis. Amid this wealth of new knowledge, we highlight several advances of particular relevance to tumor physiology. Gradations of the Angiogenic Switch. Once angiogenesis has been activated, tumors exhibit diverse patterns of neovascularization. Some tumors, including such highly aggressive types as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, are hypovascularized and replete with stromal “deserts” that are largely avascular and indeed may even be actively antiangiogenic. Many other tumors, including human renal and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas, are highly angiogenic and consequently densely vascularized. Collectively, such observations suggest an initial tripping of the angiogenic switch during tumor development that is followed by a variable intensity of ongoing neovascularization, the latter being controlled by a complex biological rheostat that involves both the cancer cells and the associated stromal microenvironment. Of note, the switching mechanism can vary in its form, even though the net result is a common inductive signal (e.g., VEGF). In some tumors, dominant oncogenes operating within tumor cells, such as Ras and Myc, can upregulate expression of angiogenic factors, whereas in others, such inductive signals are produced indirectly by immune inflammatory cells, as discussed below. The direct induction of angiogenesis by oncogenes that also drive proliferative signaling illustrates the important principle that distinct hallmark capabilities can be coregulated by the same transforming agents. Endogenous Angiogenesis Inhibitors Present Natural Barriers to Tumor Angiogenesis. Research in the 1990s revealed that TSP-1 as well as fragments of plasmin (angiostatin) and type 18 collagen (endostatin) can act as endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis. The last decade has seen reports of another dozen such agents. Most are proteins, and many are derived by proteolytic cleavage of structural proteins that are not themselves angiogenic regulators. A number of these endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis can be detected in the circulation of normal mice and humans. The genes encoding several endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors have been deleted from the mouse germline without untoward physiological effects; the growth of autochthonous and implanted tumors, however, is enhanced as a consequence. By contrast, if the circulating levels of an endogenous inhibitor are genetically increased (e.g., via overexpression in transgenic mice or in xenotransplanted tumors), tumor growth is impaired; interestingly, wound healing and fat deposition are impaired or accelerated by elevated or ablated expression of such genes. The data suggest that such endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors serve under normal circumstances as physiologic regulators that modulate transitory angiogenesis during tissue remodeling and wound healing; they may also act as intrinsic barriers to induction and/or persistence of angiogenesis by incipient neoplasias. Pericytes Are Important Components of the Tumor Neovasculature. Pericytes have long been known as supporting cells that are closely apposed to the outer surfaces of the endothelial tubes in normal tissue vasculature, where they provide important mechanical and physiologic support to the endothelial cells. Tumor-associated vasculature, in contrast, was portrayed as lacking appreciable coverage by these auxiliary cells. However, careful microscopic studies conducted in recent years have revealed that pericytes are associated, albeit loosely, with the neovasculature of most if not all tumors. More importantly, mechanistic studies discussed below have revealed that pericyte coverage is important for the maintenance of a functional tumor neovasculature. A Variety of Bone Marrow-Derived Cells Contribute to Tumor Angiogenesis. It is now clear that a repertoire of cell types originating in the bone marrow play crucial roles in pathological angiogenesis. These include cells of the innate immune system—notably macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and myeloid progenitors—that infiltrate premalignant lesions and progressed tumors and assemble at the margins of such lesions; the peri-tumoral inflammatory cells help to trip the angiogenic switch in previously quiescent tissue and to sustain ongoing angiogenesis associated with tumor growth, in addition to facilitating local invasion, as noted below. In addition, they can help protect the vasculature from the effects of drugs targeting endothelial cell signaling. Additionally, several types of bone marrow-derived “vascular progenitor cells” have been observed in certain cases to have migrated into neoplastic lesions and become intercalated into the neovasculature as pericytes or endothelial cells.";

const string hallmark6_name = "Activating Invasion and Metastasis";
const string hallmark6_description = "In 2000, the mechanisms underlying invasion and metastasis were largely an enigma. It was clear that as carcinomas arising from epithelial tissues progressed to higher pathological grades of malignancy, reflected in local invasion and distant metastasis, the associated cancer cells typically developed alterations in their shape as well as in their attachment to other cells and to the extracellular matrix (ECM). The best characterized alteration involved the loss by carcinoma cells of E-cadherin, a key cell-to-cell adhesion molecule. By forming adherens junctions with adjacent epithelial cells, E-cadherin helps to assemble epithelial cell sheets and maintain the quiescence of the cells within these sheets. Increased expression of E-cadherin was well established as an antagonist of invasion and metastasis, whereas reduction of its expression was known to potentiate these phenotypes. The frequently observed downregulation and occasional mutational inactivation of E-cadherin in human carcinomas provided strong support for its role as a key suppressor of this hallmark capability. Additionally, expression of genes encoding other cell-to-cell and cell-to-ECM adhesion molecules is demonstrably altered in some highly aggressive carcinomas, with those favoring cytostasis typically being downregulated. Conversely, adhesion molecules normally associated with the cell migrations that occur during embryogenesis and inflammation are often upregulated. For example, N-cadherin, which is normally expressed in migrating neurons and mesenchymal cells during organogenesis, is upregulated in many invasive carcinoma cells. Beyond the gain and loss of such cell-cell/matrix attachment proteins, the master regulators of invasion and metastasis were largely unknown or, when suspected, lacking in functional validation. The multistep process of invasion and metastasis has been schematized as a sequence of discrete steps, often termed the invasion-metastasis cascade. This depiction envisions a succession of cell-biologic changes, beginning with local invasion, then intravasation by cancer cells into nearby blood and lymphatic vessels, transit of cancer cells through the lymphatic and hematogenous systems, followed by escape of cancer cells from the lumina of such vessels into the parenchyma of distant tissues (extravasation), the formation of small nodules of cancer cells (micrometastases), and finally the growth of micrometastatic lesions into macroscopic tumors, this last step being termed colonization. Research into the capability for invasion and metastasis has accelerated dramatically over the past decade as powerful new research tools and refined experimental models have become available, and as critical regulatory genes were identified. While still an emerging field replete with major unanswered questions, significant progress has been made in delineating important features of this complex hallmark capability. An admittedly incomplete representation of these advances is highlighted below. The EMT Program Broadly Regulates Invasion and Metastasis. A developmental regulatory program, referred to as the “epithelial-mesenchymal transition” (EMT), has become prominently implicated as a means by which transformed epithelial cells can acquire the abilities to invade, to resist apoptosis, and to disseminate. By co-opting a process involved in various steps of embryonic morphogenesis and wound healing, carcinoma cells can concomitantly acquire multiple attributes that enable invasion and metastasis. This multifaceted EMT program can be activated transiently or stably, and to differing degrees, by carcinoma cells during the course of invasion and metastasis. A set of pleiotropically acting transcriptional factors, including Snail, Slug, Twist, and Zeb1/2, orchestrate the EMT and related migratory processes during embryogenesis; most were initially identified by developmental genetics. These transcriptional regulators are expressed in various combinations in a number of malignant tumor types and have been shown in experimental models of carcinoma formation to be causally important for programming invasion; some have been found to elicit metastasis when ectopically overexpressed. Included among the cell-biological traits evoked by such transcription factors are loss of adherens junctions and associated conversion from a polygonal/epithelial to a spindly/fibroblastic morphology, expression of matrix-degrading enzymes, increased motility, and heightened resistance to apoptosis—all traits implicated in the processes of invasion and metastasis. Several of these transcription factors can directly repress E-cadherin gene expression, thereby depriving neoplastic epithelial cells of this key suppressor of motility and invasiveness. The available evidence suggests that these transcription factors regulate one another as well as overlapping sets of target genes. No rules have yet been established to describe their interactions and the conditions that govern their expression. Evidence from developmental genetics indicates that contextual signals received from neighboring cells in the embryo are involved in triggering expression of these transcription factors in those cells destined to pass through an EMT; in an analogous fashion, increasing evidence suggests that heterotypic interactions of cancer cells with adjacent tumor-associated stromal cells can induce expression of the malignant cell phenotypes that are known to be choreographed by one or more of these transcriptional regulators. Moreover, cancer cells at the invasive margins of certain carcinomas can be seen to have undergone an EMT, suggesting that these cancer cells are subject to microenvironmental stimuli distinct from those received by cancer cells located in the cores of these lesions. Although the evidence is still incomplete, it would appear that EMT-inducing transcription factors are able to orchestrate most steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade save the final step of colonization. We still know rather little about the various manifestations and temporal stability of the mesenchymal state produced by an EMT. Although expression of EMT-inducing transcription factors has been observed in certain nonepithelial tumor types, such as sarcomas and neuroectodermal tumors, their roles in programming malignant traits in these tumors are presently poorly documented. Additionally, it remains to be determined whether invasive carcinoma cells necessarily acquire their capability through activation of parts of the EMT program, or whether alternative regulatory programs can also enable this capability. Heterotypic Contributions of Stromal Cells to Invasion and Metastasis. It is increasingly apparent that crosstalk between cancer cells and cells of the neoplastic stroma is involved in the acquired capability for invasive growth and metastasis. Such signaling may impinge on carcinoma cells and act to alter their hallmark capabilities as suggested above. For example, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) present in the tumor stroma have been found to secrete CCL5/RANTES in response to signals released by cancer cells; CCL5 then acts reciprocally on the cancer cells to stimulate invasive behavior. Macrophages at the tumor periphery can foster local invasion by supplying matrix-degrading enzymes such as metalloproteinases and cysteine cathepsin proteases; in one model system, the invasion-promoting macrophages are activated by IL-4 produced by the cancer cells. And in an experimental model of metastatic breast cancer, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) supply epidermal growth factor (EGF) to breast cancer cells, while the cancer cells reciprocally stimulate the macrophages with CSF-1; their concerted interactions facilitate intravasation into the circulatory system and metastatic dissemination of the cancer cells. Observations like these indicate that the phenotypes of high-grade malignancy do not arise in a strictly cell-autonomous manner, and that their manifestation cannot be understood solely through analyses of tumor cell genomes. One important implication, still untested, is that the ability to negotiate most of the steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade may be acquired in certain tumors without the requirement that the associated cancer cells undergo additional mutations beyond those that were needed for primary tumor formation. Plasticity in the Invasive Growth Program. The role of contextual signals in inducing an invasive growth capability (often via an EMT) implies the possibility of reversibility, in that cancer cells that have disseminated from a primary tumor to a more distant tissue site may no longer benefit from the activated stroma and invasion/EMT-inducing signals that they experienced while residing in the primary tumor; in the absence of ongoing exposure to these signals, carcinoma cells may revert in their new homes to a noninvasive state. Thus, carcinoma cells that have undergone an EMT during initial invasion and metastatic dissemination may pass through the reverse process, termed the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). This plasticity may result in the formation of new tumor colonies of carcinoma cells exhibiting a histopathology similar to those of carcinoma cells in the primary tumor that never underwent an EMT. Moreover, the notion that cancer cells routinely pass through a complete EMT program is likely to be simplistic; instead, in many cases, cancer cells may enter into an EMT program only partially, thereby acquiring new mesenchymal traits while continuing to express residual epithelial traits. Distinct Forms of Invasion May Underlie Different Cancer Types. The EMT program regulates a particular type of invasiveness that has been termed “mesenchymal.” In addition, two other distinct modes of invasion have been identified and implicated in cancer cell invasion. “Collective invasion” involves nodules of cancer cells advancing en masse into adjacent tissues and is characteristic of, for example, squamous cell carcinomas; interestingly, such cancers are rarely metastatic, suggesting that this form of invasion lacks certain functional attributes that facilitate metastasis. Less clear is the prevalence of an “amoeboid” form of invasion, in which individual cancer cells show morphological plasticity, enabling them to slither through existing interstices in the extracellular matrix rather than clearing a path for themselves, as occurs in both the mesenchymal and collective forms of invasion. It is presently unresolved whether cancer cells participating in the collective and amoeboid forms of invasion employ components of the EMT program, or whether entirely different cell-biological programs are responsible for choreographing these alternative invasion programs. Another emerging concept, noted above, involves the facilitation of cancer cell invasion by inflammatory cells that assemble at the boundaries of tumors, producing the extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes and other factors that enable invasive growth; these functions may obviate the need of cancer cells to produce these proteins through activation of EMT programs. Thus, cancer cells may secrete the chemoattractants that recruit the proinvasive inflammatory cells rather than producing the matrix-degrading enzymes themselves. The Daunting Complexity of Metastatic Colonization. Metastasis can be broken down into two major phases: the physical dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant tissues, and the adaptation of these cells to foreign tissue microenvironments that results in successful colonization, i.e., the growth of micrometastases into macroscopic tumors. The multiple steps of dissemination would seem to be in the purview of the EMT and similarly acting migratory programs. Colonization, however, is not strictly coupled with physical dissemination, as evidenced by the presence in many patients of myriad micrometastases that have successfully disseminated but never progress to macroscopic metastatic tumors. In some types of cancer, the primary tumor may release systemic suppressor factors that render such micrometastases dormant, as revealed clinically by explosive metastatic growth soon after resection of the primary growth. In others, however, such as breast cancer and melanoma, macroscopic metastases may erupt decades after a primary tumor has been surgically removed or pharmacologically destroyed; these metastatic tumor growths evidently reflect dormant micrometastases that have solved, after much trial and error, the complex problem of tissue colonization. One can infer from such natural histories that micrometastases may lack other hallmark capabilities necessary for vigorous growth, such as the ability to activate angiogenesis; indeed the inability of certain experimentally generated dormant micrometastases to form macroscopic tumors has been ascribed to their failure to activate tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, recent experiments have shown that nutrient starvation can induce intense autophagy that causes cancer cells to shrink and adopt a state of reversible dormancy; such cells may exit this state and resume active growth and proliferation when changes in tissue microenvironment, such as access to more nutrients, permit. Other mechanisms of micrometastatic dormancy may involve anti-growth signals embedded in normal tissue extracellular matrix and tumor-suppressing actions of the immune system. Most disseminated cancer cells are likely to be poorly adapted, at least initially, to the microenvironment of the tissue in which they have landed. Accordingly, each type of disseminated cancer cell may need to develop its own set of ad hoc solutions to the problem of thriving in the microenvironment of one or another foreign tissue. These adaptations might require hundreds of distinct colonization programs, each dictated by the type of disseminating cancer cell and the nature of the tissue microenvironment in which colonization is proceeding. As further discussed below, however, certain tissue microenviroments may be preordained to be intrinsically hospitable to disseminated cancer cells. Metastatic dissemination has long been depicted as the last step in multistep primary tumor progression, and indeed for many tumors that is likely the case, as illustrated by recent genome sequencing studies that present genetic evidence for clonal evolution of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to metastasis. On the other hand, evidence has recently emerged indicating that cells can disseminate remarkably early, dispersing from ostensibly noninvasive premalignant lesions in both mice and humans. Additionally, micrometastases can be spawned from primary tumors that are not obviously invasive but possess a neovasculature lacking in lumenal integrity. Although cancer cells can clearly disseminate from such pre-neoplastic lesions and seed the bone marrow and other tissues, their capability to colonize these sites and develop into pathologically significant macrometastases remains unproven. At present, we view this early metastatic dissemination as a demonstrable phenomenon in mice and humans whose clinical significance is yet to be established. Beyond the timing of their dissemination, it also remains unclear when and where cancer cells develop the ability to colonize foreign tissues as macroscopic tumors. This capability may arise during primary tumor formation as a result of a tumor's particular developmental path prior to any dissemination, such that primary tumor cells entering the circulation are fortuitously endowed with the ability to colonize certain distant tissue sites. Alternatively, the ability to colonize specific tissues may only develop in response to the selective pressure on already disseminated cancer cells to adapt to growth in foreign tissue microenvironments. Having developed such tissue-specific colonizing ability, the cells in metastatic colonies may proceed to disseminate further, not only to new sites in the body but also back to the primary tumors in which their ancestors arose. Accordingly, tissue-specific colonization programs that are evident among cells within a primary tumor may originate not from classical tumor progression occurring within the primary lesion but instead from emigrants that have returned home. Such reseeding is consistent with the aforementioned studies of human pancreatic cancer metastasis. Stated differently, the phenotypes and underlying gene expression programs of the populations of cancer cells (and of the cancer stem cells discussed below) within primary tumors may be significantly modified by reverse migration of their distant metastatic progeny. Implicit in this self-seeding process is another notion: the supportive stroma that arises in a primary tumor and contributes to its acquisition of malignant traits may intrinsically provide a hospitable site for reseeding and colonization by circulating cancer cells emanating from metastatic lesions. Clarifying the regulatory programs that enable metastatic colonization represents an important agenda for future research. Substantial progress is being made, for example, in defining sets of genes (“metastatic signatures”) that correlate with and appear to facilitate the establishment of macroscopic metastases in specific tissues. The challenge is considerable, given the apparent multitude of distinct colonization programs cited above. Moreover, colonization is unlikely to depend exclusively on cell-autonomous processes. Instead, it almost certainly requires the establishment of a permissive tumor microenvironment composed of critical stromal support cells. For these reasons, the process of colonization is likely to encompass a large number of cell-biological programs that are, in aggregate, considerably more complex and diverse than the preceding steps of metastatic dissemination.";

const string hallmark7_name = "Genome Instability and Mutation";
const string hallmark7_description = "Acquisition of the multiple hallmarks enumerated above depends in large part on a succession of alterations in the genomes of neoplastic cells. Simply depicted, certain mutant genotypes confer selective advantage on subclones of cells, enabling their outgrowth and eventual dominance in a local tissue environment. Accordingly, multistep tumor progression can be portrayed as a succession of clonal expansions, each of which is triggered by the chance acquisition of an enabling mutant genotype. Because heritable phenotypes, e.g., inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, can also be acquired through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, some clonal expansions may well be triggered by nonmutational changes affecting the regulation of gene expression. The extraordinary ability of genome maintenance systems to detect and resolve defects in the DNA ensures that rates of spontaneous mutation are usually very low during each cell generation. In the course of acquiring the roster of mutant genes needed to orchestrate tumorigenesis, cancer cells often increase the rates of mutation. This mutability is achieved through increased sensitivity to mutagenic agents, through a breakdown in one or several components of the genomic maintenance machinery, or both. In addition, the accumulation of mutations can be accelerated by compromising the surveillance systems that normally monitor genomic integrity and force genetically damaged cells into either senescence or apoptosis. The role of TP53 is central here, leading to its being called the “guardian of the genome”. A diverse array of defects affecting various components of the DNA-maintenance machinery—often referred to as the “caretakers” of the genome have been documented. The catalog of defects in these caretaker genes includes those whose products are involved in (1) detecting DNA damage and activating the repair machinery, (2) directly repairing damaged DNA, and (3) inactivating or intercepting mutagenic molecules before they have damaged the DNA. From a genetic perspective, these caretaker genes behave much like tumor suppressor genes, in that their functions can be lost during the course of tumor progression, with such losses being achieved either through inactivating mutations or via epigenetic repression. Mutant copies of many of these caretaker genes have been introduced into the mouse germline and result, predictably, in increased cancer incidence, supporting their potential involvement in human cancer development. In the decade since we first enumerated the cancer hallmarks, another major source of tumor-associated genomic instability has been uncovered: as described earlier, the loss of telomeric DNA in many tumors generates karyotypic instability and associated amplification and deletion of chromosomal segments. When viewed in this light, telomerase is more than an enabler of the hallmark capability for unlimited replicative potential and must also be added to the list of critical caretakers responsible for maintaining genome integrity. Advances in the molecular-genetic analysis of cancer cell genomes have provided the most compelling demonstrations of function-altering mutations and of ongoing genomic instability during tumor progression. One type of analysis—comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)—documents the gains and losses of gene copy number across the cell genome; in many tumors, the pervasive genomic aberrations revealed by CGH provide clear evidence for loss of control of genome integrity. Importantly, the recurrence of specific aberrations (both amplifications and deletions) at particular sites in the genome indicates that such sites are likely to harbor genes whose alteration favors neoplastic progression. More recently, with the advent of efficient and economical DNA-sequencing technologies, higher-resolution analyses have become possible. Early studies are revealing distinctive patterns of DNA mutations in different tumor types. In the not-too-distant future, the sequencing of entire cancer cell genomes promises to clarify the prevalence of ostensibly random mutations scattered across cancer cell genomes. Thus, recurring genetic alterations may point to a causal role of particular mutations in tumor pathogenesis. Although the specifics of genome alteration vary dramatically between different tumor types, the large number of genome maintenance and repair defects that have already been documented in human tumors, together with abundant evidence of widespread destabilization of gene copy number and nucleotide sequence, persuade us that instability of the genome is inherent to the great majority of human cancer cells. This leads, in turn, to the conclusion that the defects in genome maintenance and repair are selectively advantageous and therefore instrumental for tumor progression, if only because they accelerate the rate at which evolving premalignant cells can accumulate favorable genotypes. As such, genome instability is clearly an enabling characteristic that is causally associated with the acquisition of hallmark capabilities.";

const string hallmark8_name = "Tumor-Promoting Inflammation";
const string hallmark8_description = "Pathologists have long recognized that some tumors are densely infiltrated by cells of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system and thereby mirror inflammatory conditions arising in non-neoplastic tissues. With the advent of better markers for accurately identifying the distinct cell types of the immune system, it is now clear that virtually every neoplastic lesion contains immune cells present at densities ranging from subtle infiltrations detectable only with cell type-specific antibodies to gross inflammations that are apparent even by standard histochemical staining techniques. Historically, such immune responses were largely thought to reflect an attempt by the immune system to eradicate tumors, and indeed, there is increasing evidence for antitumoral responses to many tumor types with an attendant pressure on the tumor to evade immune destruction, as discussed below. By 2000, there were already clues that the tumor-associated inflammatory response had the unanticipated, paradoxical effect of enhancing tumorigenesis and progression, in effect helping incipient neoplasias to acquire hallmark capabilities. In the ensuing decade, research on the intersections between inflammation and cancer pathogenesis has blossomed, producing abundant and compelling demonstrations of the functionally important tumor-promoting effects that immune cells—largely of the innate immune system—have on neoplastic progression. Inflammation can contribute to multiple hallmark capabilities by supplying bioactive molecules to the tumor microenvironment, including growth factors that sustain proliferative signaling, survival factors that limit cell death, proangiogenic factors, extracellular matrix-modifying enzymes that facilitate angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, and inductive signals that lead to activation of EMT and other hallmark-facilitating programs. Importantly, inflammation is in some cases evident at the earliest stages of neoplastic progression and is demonstrably capable of fostering the development of incipient neoplasias into full-blown cancers. Additionally, inflammatory cells can release chemicals, notably reactive oxygen species, that are actively mutagenic for nearby cancer cells, accelerating their genetic evolution toward states of heightened malignancy. As such, inflammation can be considered an enabling characteristic for its contributions to the acquisition of core hallmark capabilities. The cells responsible for this enabling characteristic are described in the section below on the tumor microenvironment.";

const string hallmark9_name = "Reprogramming Energy Metabolism";
const string hallmark9_description = "The chronic and often uncontrolled cell proliferation that represents the essence of neoplastic disease involves not only deregulated control of cell proliferation but also corresponding adjustments of energy metabolism in order to fuel cell growth and division. Under aerobic conditions, normal cells process glucose, first to pyruvate via glycolysis in the cytosol and thereafter to carbon dioxide in the mitochondria; under anaerobic conditions, glycolysis is favored and relatively little pyruvate is dispatched to the oxygen-consuming mitochondria. Otto Warburg first observed an anomalous characteristic of cancer cell energy metabolism: even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells can reprogram their glucose metabolism, and thus their energy production, by limiting their energy metabolism largely to glycolysis, leading to a state that has been termed “aerobic glycolysis.” The existence of this metabolic switch in cancer cells has been substantiated in the ensuing decades. Such reprogramming of energy metabolism is seemingly counterintuitive, in that cancer cells must compensate for the ∼18-fold lower efficiency of ATP production afforded by glycolysis relative to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. They do so in part by upregulating glucose transporters, notably GLUT1, which substantially increases glucose import into the cytoplasm. Indeed, markedly increased uptake and utilization of glucose have been documented in many human tumor types, most readily by noninvasively visualizing glucose uptake using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radiolabeled analog of glucose (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, FDG) as a reporter. Glycolytic fueling has been shown to be associated with activated oncogenes (e.g., RAS, MYC) and mutant tumor suppressors (e.g., TP53), whose alterations in tumor cells have been selected primarily for their benefits in conferring the hallmark capabilities of cell proliferation, avoidance of cytostatic controls, and attenuation of apoptosis. This reliance on glycolysis can be further accentuated under the hypoxic conditions that operate within many tumors: the hypoxia response system acts pleiotropically to upregulate glucose transporters and multiple enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. Thus, both the Ras oncoprotein and hypoxia can independently increase the levels of the HIF1α and HIF2α transcription factors, which in turn upregulate glycolysis. A functional rationale for the glycolytic switch in cancer cells has been elusive, given the relatively poor efficiency of generating ATP by glycolysis relative to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. According to one long-forgotten and recently revived and refined hypothesis, increased glycolysis allows the diversion of glycolytic intermediates into various biosynthetic pathways, including those generating nucleosides and amino acids; this facilitates, in turn, the biosynthesis of the macromolecules and organelles required for assembling new cells. Moreover, Warburg-like metabolism seems to be present in many rapidly dividing embryonic tissues, once again suggesting a role in supporting the large-scale biosynthetic programs that are required for active cell proliferation. Interestingly, some tumors have been found to contain two subpopulations of cancer cells that differ in their energy-generating pathways. One subpopulation consists of glucose-dependent (“Warburg-effect”) cells that secrete lactate, whereas cells of the second subpopulation preferentially import and utilize the lactate produced by their neighbors as their main energy source, employing part of the citric acid cycle to do so. These two populations evidently function symbiotically: the hypoxic cancer cells depend on glucose for fuel and secrete lactate as waste, which is imported and preferentially used as fuel by their better-oxygenated brethren. Although this provocative mode of intratumoral symbiosis has yet to be generalized, the cooperation between lactate-secreting and lactate-utilizing cells to fuel tumor growth is in fact not an invention of tumors but rather again reflects cooption of a normal physiological mechanism, in this case one operating in muscle. Additionally, it is becoming apparent that oxygenation, ranging from normoxia to hypoxia, is not necessarily static in tumors but instead fluctuates temporally and regionally, likely as a result of the instability and chaotic organization of the tumor-associated neovasculature. Altered energy metabolism is proving to be as widespread in cancer cells as many of the other cancer-associated traits that have been accepted as hallmarks of cancer. This realization raises the question of whether deregulating cellular energy metabolism is therefore a core hallmark capability of cancer cells that is as fundamental as the six well-established core hallmarks. In fact, the redirection of energy metabolism is largely orchestrated by proteins that are involved in one way or another in programming the core hallmarks of cancer. When viewed in this way, aerobic glycolysis is simply another phenotype that is programmed by proliferation-inducing oncogenes. Interestingly, activating (gain-of-function) mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH) enzymes have been reported in glioma and other human tumors. Although these mutations may prove to have been clonally selected for their ability to alter energy metabolism, there is confounding data associating their activity with elevated oxidation and stability of the HIF-1 transcription factors, which could in turn affect genome stability and angiogenesis/invasion, respectively, thus blurring the lines of phenotypic demarcation. Currently, therefore, the designation of reprogrammed energy metabolism as an emerging hallmark seems most appropriate, to highlight both its evident importance as well as the unresolved issues surrounding its functional independence from the core hallmarks.";

const string hallmark10_name = "Evading Immune Destruction";
const string hallmark10_description = "A second, still-unresolved issue surrounding tumor formation involves the role that the immune system plays in resisting or eradicating formation and progression of incipient neoplasias, late-stage tumors, and micrometastases. The long-standing theory of immune surveillance proposes that cells and tissues are constantly monitored by an ever-alert immune system, and that such immune surveillance is responsible for recognizing and eliminating the vast majority of incipient cancer cells and thus nascent tumors. According to this logic, solid tumors that do appear have somehow managed to avoid detection by the various arms of the immune system or have been able to limit the extent of immunological killing, thereby evading eradication. The role of defective immunological monitoring of tumors would seem to be validated by the striking increases of certain cancers in immunocompromised individuals. However, the great majority of these are virus-induced cancers, suggesting that much of the control of this class of cancers normally depends on reducing viral burden in infected individuals, in part through eliminating virus-infected cells. These observations, therefore, seem to shed little light on the possible role of the immune system in limiting formation of the >80% of tumors of nonviral etiology. In recent years, however, an increasing body of evidence, both from genetically engineered mice and from clinical epidemiology, suggests that the immune system operates as a significant barrier to tumor formation and progression, at least in some forms of non-virus-induced cancer. When mice genetically engineered to be deficient for various components of the immune system were assessed for the development of carcinogen-induced tumors, it was observed that tumors arose more frequently and/or grew more rapidly in the immunodeficient mice relative to immunocompetent controls. In particular, deficiencies in the development or function of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), CD4+ Th1 helper T cells, or natural killer (NK) cells each led to demonstrable increases in tumor incidence; moreover, mice with combined immunodeficiencies in both T cells and NK cells were even more susceptible to cancer development. The results indicated that, at least in certain experimental models, both the innate and adaptive cellular arms of the immune system are able to contribute significantly to immune surveillance and thus tumor eradication. In addition, transplantation experiments have shown that cancer cells that originally arose in immunodeficient mice are often inefficient at initiating secondary tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent hosts, whereas cancer cells from tumors arising in immunocompetent mice are equally efficient at initiating transplanted tumors in both types of hosts. Such behavior has been interpreted as follows: Highly immunogenic cancer cell clones are routinely eliminated in immunocompetent hosts—a process that has been referred to as “immunoediting”—leaving behind only weakly immunogenic variants to grow and generate solid tumors; such weakly immunogenic cells can thereafter colonize both immunodeficient and immunocompetent hosts. Conversely, when arising in immunodeficient hosts, the immunogenic cancer cells are not selectively depleted and can, instead, prosper along with their weakly immunogenic counterparts. When cells from such nonedited tumors are serially transplanted into syngeneic recipients, the immunogenic cancer cells are rejected when they confront, for the first time, the competent immune systems of their secondary hosts. Unanswered in these particular experiments is the question of whether the chemical carcinogens used to induce such tumors are prone to generate cancer cells that are especially immunogenic. Clinical epidemiology also increasingly supports the existence of antitumoral immune responses in some forms of human cancer. For example, patients with colon and ovarian tumors that are heavily infiltrated with CTLs and NK cells have a better prognosis than those that lack such abundant killer lymphocytes; the case for other cancers is suggestive but less compelling and is the subject of ongoing investigation. Additionally, some immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients have been observed to develop donor-derived cancers, suggesting that in the ostensibly tumor-free donors, the cancer cells were held in check, in a dormant state, by a fully functional immune system. Still, the epidemiology of chronically immunosuppressed patients does not indicate significantly increased incidences of the major forms of nonviral human cancer, as noted above. This might be taken as an argument against the importance of immune surveillance as an effective barrier to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. We note, however, that HIV and pharmacologically immunosuppressed patients are predominantly immunodeficient in the T and B cell compartments and thus do not present with the multicomponent immunological deficiencies that have been produced in the genetically engineered mutant mice lacking both NK cells and CTLs; this leaves open the possibility that such patients still have residual capability for an immunological defense against cancer that is mounted by NK and other innate immune cells. In truth, the above discussions of cancer immunology simplify tumor-host immunological interactions, as highly immunogenic cancer cells may well evade immune destruction by disabling components of the immune system that have been dispatched to eliminate them. For example, cancer cells may paralyze infiltrating CTLs and NK cells, by secreting TGF-β or other immunosuppressive factors. More subtle mechanisms operate through the recruitment of inflammatory cells that are actively immunosuppressive, including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Both can suppress the actions of cytotoxic lymphocytes. In light of these considerations and the still-rudimentary demonstrations of antitumor immunity as a significant barrier to tumor formation and progression in humans, we present immunoevasion as another emerging hallmark, whose generality as a core hallmark capability remains to be firmly established.";
